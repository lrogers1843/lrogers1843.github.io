RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO PROJECT

The project displays the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

Using Bootstrap, I've made the following items:

   A navbar

   A responsive layout

   Responsive images

The Bootstrap project uses no media queries.

A sticky footer was achieved, but still some work to do on padding and body interference.
